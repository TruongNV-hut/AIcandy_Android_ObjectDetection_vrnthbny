# Android application and Object detection

<p align="justify">
The source code in this repository is an Android application designed for object detection using the YOLO model. This basic application helps you understand how to implement AI models on Android devices. We hope it will support you on your journey to exploring artificial intelligence.

## Object detection
<p align="justify">
<strong>Object detection</strong> is a computer vision technique in machine learning that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which assigns a label to an entire image, object detection not only classifies objects but also draws bounding boxes around them to specify their exact locations. This task is crucial for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and image analysis, where understanding the context and position of objects is essential.
